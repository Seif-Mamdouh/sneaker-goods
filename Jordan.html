            Modern sneaker culture had its roots in the air; that is, the original Air Jordan that released in 1985. 
            Nike, and subsequently the Jordan Brand, has honored this iconic silhouette numerous times since with releases of the Retro 1.
            The NBA banned the original Air Jordan for not meeting the league's stringent policy on uniforms and colors. 
            Jordan wore them anyway and faced a $5,000-per-game fine as a result. 
            Recognizing a unique marketing opportunity when it presented itself, Nike happily paid the fine. And MJ rocked them all the way to his Rookie of the Year honor.

            Drawing direct inspiration from La Flame’s personal style, the Air Jordan 6 approached a full militaristic coloring. 
            Olive drab hues adorned the suede upper from front to back while more heritage-infused Infrared accents laid claim to the heel pull, the silhouette’s signature toggle, and the lace cover’s bold Jumpman branding. 
            And even though the latter boasted the same insignia hits from left to right foot, the heels chose to alternate with “Nike Air” and the “Cactus Jack” cross logo. Alongside, the cargo themes gave way to a small stow compartment along the heel, an attachment that was likely intended for illicit goods. 
            Though once a hot ticket item during October of last year, the pair has since dropped in price.

            Thanks to great performance coupled with an innovative design, the Air Jordan XI (particularly the Concord colorway) is one of the most-loved sneakers ever. 
            Sole Collector magazine voted the XI the top shoe of all time.
            Tinker Hatfield watched video of Michael Jordan and noticed MJ's foot would roll off the foot bed on hard cuts. 
            So Hatfield took that opportunity to blend substance with style, adding patent leather for the first time on a basketball shoe. Patent leather was stronger, and it fit MJ's reported desire to have a shoe that could be worn with a suit.

            Everything changed upon Travis Scott’s reverse-Swooshed Air Jordan 1, a pair that many have cited as one the best designs the silhouette has seen in all of history. 
            Ranked alongside the likes of Fragment and Union LA, the silhouette was not only noteworthy for its clean Trail End inspired colorway but also the pure shock of changing up the iconic branding to such a degree. 
            Clean suedes outfitted in brown, the underlying leathers a “Sail” much like past releases, and the side profile’s check — which was oversized alongside — changed orientations for an eccentric energy that could only belong to La Flame himself. 
            Matching that of his core style in every facet, the pair also hid a stash pocket along its ankle and a few debossed details that displayed the signature Cactus Jack head. Seen across the digital space in Fortnite and honored through many a custom, 
            the collaboration is certainly one of his best and it currently sits above the four figure threshold just as it did upon its drop in May of 2019.
