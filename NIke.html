                Nike Air Max is a line of shoes produced by Nike, Inc.
                First model released in 1987. 
                Air Max shoes are identified by their midsoles incorporating flexible urethane pouches filled with pressurized gel, visible from the exterior of the shoe and intended to provide cushioning underfoot. 
                Air Max was conceptualized by Tinker Hatfield, who initially worked for Nike designing stores, with the underlying technology being created and patented by M. Frank Rudy.

                  The Nike Cortez was created by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight. 
                  The men first met in 1957, Bowerman was the track and field coach at the University of Oregon, and Knight competed on Bowerman's team. 
                  The two friends became business partners soon after Knight bought the distribution rights of Onitsuka Tiger brand athletic shoes from Japan for the USA.
                  The initial name of their business was Blue Ribbon Sports and was later changed to Nike in 1972.
                  Although the business was distributing decent athletic shoes, Bowerman believed that athletes deserved a better track shoe than what was available. 
                  After years of designing and experimenting, Bowerman finalized his image of the Nike Cortez in 1968; and in 1972 the shoe was released.

                  Year 2002 marked the beginning of a new wave that was about to start building for sneaker culture when the Nike SB division was formed.
                  Despite not having an assessed value at over one billion dollars just yet (2002), Supreme would kickstart the momentum for the beginning of the Dunk lineage in the division’s first year in production that are considered by many collectors of today to be their all-time grails. 
                  Prior to the brand’s collaboration with the now renowned streetwear label, Nike SB would really begin to turn the heads of core skate advocates by giving esteemed pros of the era, like Gino Ianucci, Reese Forbes, Danny Supa, and Richard Mulder their own signature colorways of the Dunk Low Pro SB.

                  This season’s Supreme x Nike Air Force 1 sold out almost immediately upon its release, leaving many sneakerheads unable to get their hands on a pair of the hyped sneakers. 
                  Those familiar with Supreme drops should not have been surprised. 
                  Still, people took to social media to voice their frustrations, many blaming resellers and bots for the fast sell-out times.
